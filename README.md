This is a simple project I am developing in order to learn Oracle SQL and practice with github.  Currently the project is a simple database that is accessed through Java command line instructions.  It stores information about friends in a 6 column table.  It can do things like print the table, print a single record, add records and delete records.  To perform the full table printout it employs some nifty code that I borrowed from someone else's github project and did some slight mods to make it work with Oracle DB.

I hope to add more features soon and eventually a JavaFX GUI to control everything instead of the command line.  Possibly eventually I will add a web-interface as well.
